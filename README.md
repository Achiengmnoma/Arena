Real-Time Multiplayer Game Server (with Betting Feature)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MwauratheAlex/arena.git
   cd arena
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

## If using intellij hot-reloading
1. **Watch for tailwind changes on a separate terminal**
   ```bash
   cd arena/src/main/frontend
   npm i #install node modules if running for the first time
   npm run watch #to watch html files for changes and rebuild your css
   ```
2. **Run Normally on intellij**
- Tailwind will build automatically on save, and you only need to rerun your server on changes.
- If running templates directly with the intellij server and hot-reloading, 
tailwind will still build automatically on save, and you will see changes immediately on your browser.
- NOTE: mvn spring-boot:run will install packages and 
build tailwind so there is no need to run watch separately.
